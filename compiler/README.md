# Complement Evaluators and Compilers

The compilation passes and various interpreter versions are here, written in
Racket using the [Nanopass Framework](http://nanopass.org/).

# TODO

* FFI calls.
* Refactoring.
* Testing.
* Avoid needless moves at callsites with some register targeting scheme.
* Would be nice to have at least some optimizations.
